# 2-Wheeled RC Car with Raspberry Pi 4
Welcome to the 2-Wheeled RC Car project, powered by a Raspberry Pi 4! This README provides an introduction and some essential information about the project.

## Description

The 2-Wheeled RC Car is a remote-controlled car that utilizes a Raspberry Pi 4 as its brain. 

The car's two wheels are independently controlled using a motor driver connected to the Raspberry Pi. By running custom code on the Raspberry Pi, you can wirelessly control the car's movement, enabling it to go forward, backward, turn left, turn right, and perform other maneuvers.

(the rc is inspierd from the game rainbow 6 and watchdogs)
